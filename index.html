					At Mirkin Electrology you will experience electrolysis treatments using a combination of technology, education and expertise to begin the process of permanent hair removal. Located in the Salon Suites Building in the Crown Pointe Office Plaza, in Lansing Michigan,  Mirkin Electrology, is in a private space catering to the hair removal needs of all clients.
				</p>
				<p>
					Electrolysis can treat all skin types and colors, all hair types and colors, and with the exception of mucus membranes, nostrils and ear canals, electrolysis can be performed on all body parts.
				</p>
				<p>
					With electrolysis individual hair follicles are treated with a metal probe and small current. The goal is to destroy the follicle so hair cannot grow back in that follicle. Full destruction takes time as each hair being treated must go through several hair growth cycles to be successfully destroyed. Each client will receive an individualized program to achieve success most effectively and efficiently.
