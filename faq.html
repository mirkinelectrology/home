				<h1>FAQ’s</h1>
				<hr />

				<h2>How much time should I plan for treatment?</h2>
				<hr />
				<p>There are two time frames, one is per session and the other is the duration of treatments. Per session plan 30 minutes to an hour. Duration, at minimum is one year, because hair must go through several growth cycles to be fully destroyed. So armpits for instance. An hour per arm per session. Because there is generally more friction under your arm in a normal day, the follicles are often distorted, so we plan for about 2 years duration. I like to see you ever week for the first month every other week for the second month, and then once every 3 weeks to once a month for the remaining time. Some people don’t want to wait that long, and will come more often. Each plan is tailored specifically to the individuals body and needs.</p>

				<h2>Are there any health risks?</h2>
				<hr />
				<p>There is always a risk when dealing with needle and skin, but they are very, very minimal. Scarring can occur, but at Mirkin Electrology we take our process slow to reduce or eliminate that risk. We’re also diligent about cleanliness, disinfecting all tools and making sure that it is a safe and comfortable environment.</p>

				<h2>What parts of the body to people do most often?</h2>
				<hr />
				<p>Generally we see areas on the face most often. Lip, chin, cheeks, eyebrows but we do it all.</p>

				<h2>What should I plan for after my appointment?</h2>
				<hr />
				<p>The area may appear red afterwards, so you might not want to plan to go back to work. This often lasts an hour of less, but of course everyone’s skin is different.</p>

				<h2>Do you work with men as well as women?</h2>
				<hr />
				<p>Absolutely. We will work with any gender! We are always here to help you achieve what you want achieve with your body, and to find joy, happiness and peace with your appearance.</p>

				<h2>Why did you get into electrology?</h2>
				<hr />
				<p>I was an electrolysis client, and I loved the results. I knew that it was difficult to find someone to do this, so I decided that I wanted to go through the training. I am passionate about helping people feel better about their appearance. I especially like to work with women with PCOS who feel like they have no control over the hair that grows on their face and it makes them feel hopeless. I love getting to empower them and help them feel better about their appearance.</p>

				<h2>How much is it going to cost?</h2>
				<hr />
				<p>A good rule of thumb is between $1500 and $2000/year of services with the suggested schedule. We will tailor to an individual’s budget.</p>

				<h2>Do you do free consultations?</h2>
				<hr />
				<p>Yes! Reach out to me any time to chat about what you want to achieve and we can make a plan. This is a relationship, and I value getting to know you and your goals. I always joke with my patients that I don’t charge for the psychology visit along with the treatment.</p>

				<h2>What do you recommend for before and after care?</h2>
				<hr />
				<p>Drink lots of water prior to your visit. Stay out of the sun 48 hours prior to your visit, we can’t have a treatment if the skin is sunburned. Keep you skin clean, washing the area once or twice a day. No exercise the day of your appointment. Avoid excessive sweating for 24 hours after treatment (exercise, sauna, hot tub, etc.). Drink water after your session as well. Did I mention making sure you’re drinking a lot of water? No alcohol the day of treatment.</p>
