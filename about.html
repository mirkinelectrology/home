				<h2>What is Electrolysis</h2>
				<p>
					Electrolysis uses a small probe and light current to treat individual hair follicles preventing hair from growing back. Electrolysis is a process that requires commitment and treatment plans and schedules are created specifically for individuals to achieve success in the most efficient way.

				<p style='display: inline-block;'>
					After more than 25 years in outside sales, it was time for a change. In the time following my career departure, I set off to the American Institute of Education, in Tustin California, to learn about Electrolysis, came back to Michigan to be licensed and began my practice. Like many other electrologists who choose this career, I was an electrolysis client who was thrilled at the results achieved by my treatments.
				</p>
				<p>
					To say I am passionate about my craft is an understatement. Helping people get rid of unwanted hair brings joy to my clients which thrills and excites me when they realize the positive results.
